              <h3>The Basics</h3>
              <p>
                Curling is played between two teams, each taking turns sliding
                stones on an ice sheet to a target area. The goal is to have
                your stones closest to the center.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="rule-card">
              <h3>Scoring</h3>
              <p>
                Points are awarded for each stone closer to the center than the
                opponentâ€™s closest stone at the end of an "end" (round).
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="rule-card">
              <h3>Sweeping</h3>
              <p>
                Sweeping helps control the stone's speed and direction. Sweepers
                use brooms to smooth the ice in front of the stone.
              </p>

            <div className="rule-card">
              <h3>Turn Order</h3>
              <p>
                Teams alternate turns, with each player delivering two stones
                per end, starting with the lead and finishing with the skip.

              <h3>Guarding</h3>
              <p>
                Placing stones in front of the house to protect your scoring
                stones or make it harder for the opponent to score.

                Sliding the stone gently into a specific position within the
                house to score or gain a tactical advantage.

              <h3>Takeouts</h3>
              <p>
                Knocking the opponentâ€™s stones out of play to reduce their
                scoring potential.

                Placing a stone directly next to or in front of an opponent's
                stone to limit their options.
